===== Resource Setup/Alloc =====
**Providing setup:**
  - Get the device //multiple cores on the same devices
  - Create a context //enable sharing of memiry b/n devices
  - Create command queues //to talk with devices, EACH DEVICE MUST HAVE A QUEUE

    // Get the platform ID
    cl_platform_id platform;
    clGetPlatformIDs(1, &platform, NULL);
    // Get the first GPU device associated with the platform
    cl_device_id device;
    clGetDeviceIDs(platform, CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU, 1, &device, NULL);
    // Create an OpenCL context for the GPU device
    cl_context context;
    context = clCreateContext(NULL, 1, &device, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    
    // Create a command-queue for a specific device
    cl_command_queue cmd_queue = clCreateCommandQueue(context, device_id, 0, NULL);
    
**Rule: We can share information between devices ONLY IN THE SAME CONTEXT!**
==== Choosing device ====
  * The best device is algorithm and hardware based device
  * Sometimes CPU betters, sometimes GPU (depend on algorithm)
  * clGetDeviceInfo to check device and get info
