===== Platform and Memory model =====
==== Platform model ====
  * host is connected to one or more OpenCL Devices
=== OpenCL Devics ===
  * Collection of one or more computer units (CORES)
=== Memory model ===
4 types of memory (sync):
  - Private (per work item)
  - Local (shared among group)
  - Global/Constant (Not sync)
  - Host (on CPU)
Rule : Must move data from host to global to local and back
=== Buffers ===
  * Simple chunks of memory (Buffers = simple structs, arrays, pointers)
  * kernels have access to buffers by arrays,structs,pointers
  * kernels can read and write buffers
=== Images ===
  * 2D or 3D formatted data structures
  * kernels have access only via read_image(), write_image()
  * can be read and written in kernel
== Image formats ==
Formats:

  * Channel orders: CL_A, CL_RGB, CL_RG etc [[alpha channel, or rgb channel
  * Channel data type: CL_UNORM_INTS, CL_FLOAT etc
  * clGetSupportedImageFormats() - returns supported format

Samplers(for reading):

  * Filter mode: linear or nearest //liner or nearest interpolation
  * Adressing: clamp, clamp-edge, repeat or none
  * Normalizing: true | false //normalized coordinates or not

.
    cl_image_format format;
    format.image_channel_data_type = CL_FLOAT;
    format.image_channel_order = CL_RGBA;
    
    cl_mem input_image;
    input_image = clCreateImage2D (context...)
    cl_mem ouput_image;
    output_image = clCreateImage2D (context...)
    
    cl_mem input_buffer;
    input_buffer = clCreateBuffer(context,..)
    cl_mem ouput_buffer;
    ouput_buffer = clCreateBuffer(context,..)
    
=== Access to memory object data ===
  * clEnqueueReadBuffer(...) //read buffer in memory obj to host memory
  * clEnqueueWriteBuffer(...) //write from host memory
  * clEnqueueMapBuffer(...) //map region in mem obj to host
  * clEnqueueCopyBuffer(...) //copy region of mem obj

===== OpenCL Objects =====

Setup
  - Devices - GPU/CPU/CELL
  - Contexts - Collection of Devices
  - Queues - Submit work to the device
Memory
  - Buffers - Blocks of memory 
  - Images - 2D or 3D formatted image
Execution
  - Programs - collection of kernels
  - Kernel - exectuion instance
Syncronization/Profiling
  - Events
