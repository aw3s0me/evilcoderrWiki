====== ASP.NET is server-side ======
  - Client requests a web page
  - Server runs server-side app
  - Server returns an html document
It was made to avoid several problems:
  * Isolation - client code can't access server-side resources (can't interact with db on the server
  * Security - end users can view client-side code [malicious users can understand how it works)
  * Thin Clients - web-enabled devices are everywhere (the may not support client-side programming platforms suc as Flash or Silverlight)
**BUT ASP.NET ALLOWS TO COMBINE the BEST of client-side programming with server side (AJAX + JS)**
