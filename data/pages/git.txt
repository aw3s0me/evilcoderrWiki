=== Creating A Repo ===
== Step 1: Create the README file ==
  - **mkdir ~/Hello-World**  # Creates a directory for your project called "Hello-World" in your user directory
  - **cd ~/Hello-World**     # Changes the current working directory to your newly created directory
  - **git init**             # Sets up the necessary Git files
  - **touch README**         # Creates a file called "README" in your Hello-World directory
== Step 2: Commit your README ==
  - **git add README**               # Stages your README file, adding it to the list of files to be committed
  - **git commit -m 'first commit'** # Commits your files, adding the message "first commit"
== Step 3: Push your commit ==
  - **git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Hello-World.git** # Creates a remote named "origin" pointing at your GitHub repository
  - **git push origin master** # Sends your commits in the "master" branch to GitHub
