====== ASP.NET ======
Platofrm for developing web applications. Microsoft created ASP.NET because, early web had two key problems:
  - They didn't scale well
  - They provided little more than a bare-bones programming environment (//if we wanted features such as authentication of users or reading a database, we needed to write pages of code from scratch//)
  * Deals with controls instead a raw web page markup
  * **[[SERVER-SIDE PLATFORM]]** - all ASP.NET code runs on the web-server [ When ASP.NET code finishes running, web server sends the user final result - ordinary page to web browser ]
  * NOT CLIENT-SIDE - asks browser to download the code and execute it locally on the client computer.

==== ASP.NET MVC ====
Core idea is that app is separated into 3 logical parts:
  - Model - app code
  - View - representation of the Model, converting it into HTML
  - Controller - handling user interactions, updating the model, passing info to the view
==== History of WEB ====
  * **Began in the late 60a as an experiment** (goal - create resilient information network) Driven by potential scenarios (such as nuclear attack)

  * **93** -> First HTML browser was created -> Internet revolution began
