====== About processors ======
===== Why parallel =====
3 approaches of doing something better:
  - Doing faster
  - Buy a better instrument [is too expensive
  - Hire more workers
HIRE WORKERS = NOT FASTER, BUT MORE WORK PER STEP
===== GPU =====
A graphics processing unit (GPU), is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display
----
GPU:
  * hundreds of **processor's**
  * thousands of **ALU's**
  * tens of thousands of **threads** (average GPU has about 65 k threads)
Good at:
  * Running a LOT OF THREADS IN PARALLEL
  * Launching a lot of THREADS
===== Processors =====
Processors are made from TRANSISTORS
  * Transistors **get smaller** each year
  * Processors are getting faster cos **MORE TRANSISTORS**
  * Why not clock speed COS **HEAT**
==== Optimization ====
  * GPU is optimized for **THROUGHPUT** (How many tasks per unit - пропускная способность)
  * CPU is optimized for **LATENCY** (time to finish task - латентность)
